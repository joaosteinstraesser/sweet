# Barotropic instability benchmark, binary spectral output


This benchmark (aka Galwesky et al. benchmark) uses binary output files in spectral space. This leads the main advantages that it requires significantly less storage space (compared to text output in physical space) and it be directly used to do some transformations in spectral space:
